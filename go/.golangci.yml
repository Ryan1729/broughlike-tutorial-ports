    # The amount of statements in a func measures how many things one named unit
    # of code does, which may actually be useful to reduce. Measuring lines just
    # tracks at best, how much someone has to scroll to see all the code, and
    # given the statement limit exists, basically only measures how big
    # statements are in the code, which is more or less a non-issue.
